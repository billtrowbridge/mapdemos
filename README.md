You can use these html files directly, with no more than a text editor and a browser.

Some of the html may not work properly when hosted from the file system.  They'll require a web server to run correctly.

There are several ways to do this. 

* Use Visual Studio.
The starting point for this project is mapdemos.sln, a Visual Studio solution.  The free "Visual Studio Community" edition is available from https://www.visualstudio.com/products/free-developer-offers-vs .

* Use a python web server.
If you're working with Windows, and you'll be using the including command files to run a web server from the local directory, see these instructions: [Instructions.md](./Instructions.md)

* Use your own server.
Roll your own solution using any web server software of your choice.
